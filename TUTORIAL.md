# Developer Tutorial

> Written 7/25/23.

Hi, welcome to Bubbel's backend!
This is a tutorial aimed at ~~sike~~ beginner backend developers.

## Introduction

First of all, I believe that the best way to understand a system is the feel
comfortable about it.
So let me just say, backend development is not as complicated as you think.

### What Even Is a "Backend"

I don't like the term "backend".
It sounds much fancier that what it really is.

At its core, a backend exposes *functions* that some client calls with some
*request* expecting some *response*.
There's not much else to it, and Bubbel's backend is designed to drive home
this point by decoupling networking and logic (I'll explain this next).
